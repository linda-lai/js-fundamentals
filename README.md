## Background
Hi, hello and hey! I'm currently a student at Coder Academy completing a Diploma of Information Technology in a full-stack web development immersive bootcamp, learning JavaScript for the first time.

The contained problems were provided to students to practice JavaScript fundamentals, primarily focusing on functions and data structures to build up familiarity with syntax, logic and general programming conventions.

As a newcomer to coding and JavaScript, these were challenging but fun exercises to do, particularly as they increased in difficulty - making those ones all the more satisfying to crack!
